# ytcog (pre-release)

YouTube innertube object library, session, player, searches, channels, videos and downloads.

Simple, Efficient, Powerful and Fast. 

No Google developer key required.  To get the most from ytcog, all you need is an active YouTube account.

The innertube api is what the YouTube website itself uses to efficiently deliver search, channel and video information. So it makes sense that a YouTube download library should use it too. 

# Objects

Session - manage your Youtube session/player - enables seemless search, channel, video and download requests.

Search - fetch videos from specific search requests. 

Channel - fetch metadata and videos from specific channels.

Video - create video objects directly or from search and channel scan results - fetch metadata and stream information deciphered/encoded as necessary - bypass rate limiting and age restrictions - ensure reliable and fast downloads - no more 429s, 404s and 403s.
